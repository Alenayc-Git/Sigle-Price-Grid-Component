## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to apply basic grid layout, but i feel like the code can be better

I liked this peace of code.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 650px) {
  .price-component {
    max-width: 375px;
    min-height: 750px;
    grid-template-rows: 40% 30% 30%;
  }
  .subscription {
    border-bottom-left-radius: 0px;
  }
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 100%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue learnign grid for apply with flexbox in future projects.
